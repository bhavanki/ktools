Welcome to ktools!

This is a collection of tools for analyzing eye tracking session data. The
tools include:

- nmergen: create an nmer string from session data
- nmeran: analyze one or more nmer strings
- ffp: find first fixation patterns in one or more nmer strings
- lev: find the Levenshtein distance between strings and a base string
- nmer: scan transitions in one or more nmer strings
- isolate: narrow nmer string transitions
- finalfix: report on the final fixations in session data
- sequential: report on sequential durations in session data
- viewtimes: report on descriptor viewing times in event files
- crank: run complete analysis on a directory of session data files

Each of the files above has its own README.txt. See those files for usage
information.
