- nmeran: analyze one or more nmer strings
- ffp: find first fixation patterns in one or more nmer strings
- lev: find the Levenshtein distance between strings and a base string
- nmer: scan transitions in one or more nmer strings

Each of the files above has its own README.txt. See those files for usage
