crank runs analysis across all eye tracking session data in a given directory. Run it like this (the dollar sign is the command prompt):

$ ./crank <directory> <base-string>

The base-string is the theoretical string to use for computing Levenshtein distances. See step 4 below.

crank writes out what it's doing to standard output. It performs the following
overall tasks:

1. Runs nmergen.pl on each session data file.
2. Concatenates all nmer strings generated by step 1 into one combined file,
   with one string per line.
3. Runs nmeran.pl on the file produced in step 2.
4. Runs ffp.pl on the file produced in step 2, and then runs Lev on each first
   fixation pattern against the base string.
5. Runs NMer on the file produced in step 2 for token lengths 1 through 4.

The first two steps above are run once including numeric AOI IDs, and once again not including them. Consequently, the analysis performed in the remaining steps is performed separately on each of the files produced in step 2.

crank creates several directories under the given directory to hold output files.

* working contains working files for runs that include numeric AOI IDs.
* working_n contains working files for runs that do not include numeric AOI IDs.
* output contains final output analysis files.

The files generated by steps 1 and 2, as well as the first fixation pattern files produced in step 4, are placed in the working directories. All other files are placed in the output directory. Files in the output directory including "_n" in their names do not include numeric AOI IDs; the rest do.

If crank is run on a directory a second time, the working and output directories from the previous run are wiped out and replaced. The session data files remain untouched.
